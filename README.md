# TimeTable Management System

## Project Title
TimeTable Management System

## Description
This project aims to develop a comprehensive system for managing and optimizing academic timetables for educational institutions. It provides robust administrative tools for inputting and configuring various scheduling parameters, and an intelligent engine for generating optimized timetables. In the future, it will also offer a user-friendly, view-only interface for students and staff to access their schedules.

## Features

### Admin Capabilities
*   **Semester, Teacher, and Subject/Class Management:** Comprehensive tools for adding, editing, and deleting academic semesters, teacher profiles, and course/subject details.
*   **Daily Schedule and Working Days Configuration:** Ability to define daily class timings, including breaks, and specify the number of working days in a week for the institution.
*   **Automated Optimized Timetable Generation:** An intelligent system that generates an optimized, clash-free timetable based on all provided constraints and inputs.

### Future Enhancements
*   **Interactive Timetable Modification with Clash Revalidation:** Future versions will allow administrators to interactively modify generated timetables, with real-time revalidation to prevent clashes and deadlocks.
*   **User Timetable Viewing:** A dedicated module for users (e.g., students, teachers) to view their respective timetables in a clear and accessible format.

## Setup and Installation (Placeholder)
Detailed instructions for setting up the development environment and running the application will be provided here once the project structure is established. This will typically include:
1.  Prerequisites (e.g., Node.js, Python, Database system)
2.  Cloning the repository
3.  Installing dependencies
4.  Database setup
5.  Running the application

## Usage (Placeholder)
Instructions on how to use the Admin and User interfaces will be documented here. This will cover:
*   How to log in as an administrator.
*   Steps for inputting semesters, teachers, subjects, and daily schedules.
*   How to trigger timetable generation.
*   How users can view their timetables.
